            <h3>The Future is tech!</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Riajul Jannah, a <span>Software Developer</span> and <span>IT Specialist</span>.</p>
            <p>Basically,I had a keen interest in this sector from the very beginning. I always love to go through the creative process of an website. The full process is so addictive that opens up with many new challenges.</p>
            <p>Coding has always been a favourite Subject for me. Working with new projects always push someone to overcome his boundaries. And as it's upgrading everyday, so to keep pace with it one needs to be concious of new methods and techniques. Sometimes, i challenge myself to get some new effects in my own project. </p>
            <p>But the main part to achieve success in a project i guess is <span>Collaboration</span> and <span> Project management</span>. Collaborating with the Stackholders, listening their user stories are the primary steps to complete a project. If you have any ideas to make your own projects or requirements, feel free to knock me. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
